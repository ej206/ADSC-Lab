Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.\n",

No matter what you decide to do, make sure to provide sufficient justification of why you think what you want to do or solve is important and why would a client or a group of people be interested in your project.\n",

    "> A stylist who is also an entrepeneur looking to open a salon in either Madrid or New York would want to know several things about the neighborhoods in each city.  For instance, the person would want to know how many Salon's there are in each neighborhood of each city to get a feel for what the competition would be like.  In order to pick an ideal location, the person would also want to know what other kinds of businesses are predominant in each neighborhood.  Of course, the person would want the location to have other types of businesses that are complimentary to the services they will be providing.  For instance, it would probably not be a good idea to open a salon in a predominantly fish selling market.  Or to open a salon in a neighborhood where there are already a glut of salons."
